# My internship at IT-Development

## Description

I completed a 6-month internship at [IT-Development](https://fr.it-development.com/) as a pentester.
My role was to search for security vulnerabilities in the company's web applications so that developers could fix them.

For this, I carried out security audits, penetration tests and I participated in the implementation of security solutions.

## The company

IT-Development (ITD) is a software development company that markets innovative solutions for mobile network operators and towercos.

The team is mainly composed of developers, devops and business analysts and has about 50 people.

## My missions

### Penetration tests

ITD uses an external security auditor to carry out penetration tests on its applications. My role is to prepare these audits, to support the auditor in exploring the product and to ensure the implementation of corrective measures.
I also carry out regular penetration tests in order to find more advanced security flaws by taking more time than the external auditor.

### Writing tickets

I also participated in the writing of security tickets for developers. These tickets describe the security flaws that I found and the steps to follow to correct them.

### Example of security flaws found

These vulnerabilities were found during my penetration tests and were corrected by the developers:

- SQL Injection
- RCE
- Privilege escalation
- XSS
- CSRF
