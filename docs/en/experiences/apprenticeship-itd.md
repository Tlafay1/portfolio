# My apprenticeship at IT-Development

## Description

I am currently on a work-study program at IT-Development as a DevSecOps Expert. My role is to participate in securing the company's web and mobile applications. To do this, I conduct security audits, penetration tests, and participate in the implementation of security solutions.

## The company :office:

![ITD logo](/assets/itd-logo.png)

IT-Development (ITD) is a software development company that markets innovative solutions for mobile network operators and towercos.

The team is mainly composed of developers, devops, and business analysts and has about 50 people.

## My missions :man_technologist:

### Penetration testing

ITD uses an external security auditor to perform penetration tests on its applications. My role is to prepare these audits, to accompany the auditor in exploring the product and to ensure that the corrections are implemented.
I also carry out regular penetration tests in order to find more advanced security flaws by taking more time than the external auditor.

### DevSecOps

I participate in the implementation of security solutions for the company's applications. The goal is to automate security management as much as possible, using vulnerability scans, automated penetration tests, and container security tools.

### Development

I also write a bit of code (mainly backend), especially to fix problems related to the security of the product, when it falls within my area of expertise. This allowed me to discover Java (the language I love to hate the most) and the Spring Boot framework. For example, I was able to improve the protections of the types of files uploaded by users and correct path traversal vulnerabilities.

This allows me to progress enormously, because I am convinced that it is important to understand how flaws appear in order to better detect them!
